I'm currently a junior pursuing Computer Science at Columbia University. I love building software that makes a real differenceâ€”whether itâ€™s crafting an app, creating tools to solve challenging problems, or just making life a little easier with code. At the same time, I'm eagerly exploring the possibilities of machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs) in scientific fields.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm focusing on:
- Researching domain-specific large language models (LLMs), and application of GNNs on knowledge graphs and ontology
- Developing scalable, user-centric applications
